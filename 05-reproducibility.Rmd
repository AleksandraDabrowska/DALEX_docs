# Reproducibility

Packages are changing quite fast, especially in actively developed areas.
Below you will find list of packages that were installed on my computer when I was preparing this documentation.

It is likely that some of described packages will change names of functions or arguments or structure of results. Use the version listed below to reproduce results form this book.

Note, that results, models and plots created in are were recorded with the **archivist** package [@archivist]. Use archivist links to retrieve their binary copies directly to your R console.
