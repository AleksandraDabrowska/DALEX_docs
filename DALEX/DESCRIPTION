Description: Machine Learning models are widely used and have various applications in classification 
  or regression tasks. Due to increasing computational power, availability of new data sources and new 
  methods, ML models are more and more complex. Models created with techniques like boosting, bagging 
  of neural networks are true black boxes. It is hard to trace the link between input variables and 
  model outcomes. They are use because of high performance, but lack of interpretability is one of 
  their weakest sides. In many applications we need to know, understand or prove how input 
  variables are used in the model and what impact do they have on final model prediction. 
  DALEX is a set of tools that help to understand how complex models are working.
