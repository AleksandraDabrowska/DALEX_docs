# Introduction

Machine Learning models are widely used and have various applications in classification or regression tasks. Due to increasing computational power, availability of new data sources and new methods, ML models are more and more complex. Models created with techniques like boosting, bagging of neural networks are true black boxes. It is hard to trace the link between input variables and model outcomes. They are use because of high performance, but lack of interpretability is one of their weakest sides.

In many applications we need to know, understand or prove how input variables are used in the model and what impact do they have on final model prediction.
DALEX is a set of tools that help to understand how complex models are working.

## Trivia

![](images/dalex01small.jpg)

[The Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) are a fictional extraterrestrial race portrayed in the [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) BBC series. Rather dim aliens, known to repeat the phrase *Explain!* very often.



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

## Usecase - classification

To ilustrate applications of DALEX to binary classification problems we will use a dataset from Kaggle competition [Human Resources Analytics]( https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics/data). This dataset is avaliable in the **breakDown** package [@breakDown].

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("breakDown")
head(HR_data)
```

```{r hr_data, echo=FALSE}
library("breakDown")
knitr::kable(
  head(HR_data),
  caption = 'HR_data dataset from Kaggle competition Human Resources Analytics'
  )
```

### Logistic regression

In the following chapters to present explainers for logistic regression models we will use `HR_glm_model`.

```{r, }
HR_glm_model <- glm(left~., data = HR_data, family = "binomial")
summary(HR_glm_model)
```

Models used in this doccumentation are accessible via **archivist** package [@archivist]. To download the `HR_glm_model` model use: `archivist::aread("pbiecek/DALEX/arepo/8fe19a108faf3ddfcabc3de3a0693234")`

## Usecase - regression

Some _significant_ applications are demonstrated in this chapter.
