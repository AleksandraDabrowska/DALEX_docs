Explainers presented in this chapter are designed to better understand the local structure of a black box in a single point. Example applications:

* explanations for predictions. Can be used to validate if a specific prediction is not accidental, is it based on variables important in the domain.
* examination of curvature around a specific point (single observation). Can be used to determine the strength of influence onto a final model. Is it an outlier?

There are more interesting applications. Find out some of them in the *Why Should I Trust You?* article [@lime].

## Local Interpretable (Model-agnostic) Visual Explanations 

The **live** package (see [@live]) may be seen as an extension of the lime method (see [@lime]). It is based on **mlr** general framework for training of machine learning models (see more [@mlr]).

Let's see an example. We will use the `HR_rf_model` trained with the **randomForest** package on Human Resources Analytics data.

Around a selected point we will fit a linear model.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("live")
library("randomForest")
library("breakDown")

HR_rf_model <- randomForest(left~., data = HR_data,
ntree=100)

similar <- sample_locally(data = HR_data, explained_instance = HR_data[2,], explained_var = "left", size = 2000)
trained <- fit_explanation( live_object = similar, white_box = "regr.lm", selection = FALSE)
```
**TODO**

Instructions above results in: `Error in n_distinct_multi(list(...), na.rm) : is of unsupported type NULL`

**TODO**



Fitted model may be plotted with *waterfall plot* ...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_explanation(trained, "waterfallplot", explained_instance = HR_data[1,])
```

... or *forest plot* ...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_explanation(trained, "forestplot", explained_instance = HR_data[1,])
```
