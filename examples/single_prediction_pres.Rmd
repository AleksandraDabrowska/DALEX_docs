```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```


Why?
---

  - to increase *trust* in important predictions
  - to *understand* which factors drive the prediction 
  - to inspect unusual/outlier predictions
  - to improve the model
